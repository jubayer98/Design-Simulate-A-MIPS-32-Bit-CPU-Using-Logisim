# Design-Simulate-A-MIPS-32-Bit-CPU-Using-Logisim
We will implement a subset of the MIPS 32bit architecture in Logisim. We will implement a 32-bit pipelined version of the MIPS architecture. Our objective is to implement basic MIPS code.

We will implement a subset of the MIPS 32bit architecture in Logisim. We will implement a 32-bit pipelined version of the MIPS architecture. Our objective is to implement basic MIPS code.
In this project, we are going to design the datapath and control using with the help of Logisim. This design satisfies all the rules of two complete the cycle for the execution of the instruction. Let’s show an example,
Let,
𝑪 code is : 𝐴 = 𝐵+𝐶;
Assembly code : 𝑎𝑑𝑑 𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 # 𝑎 is the sum of 𝑏 and 𝑐
Machine code : 00000010001100100100000000100000
